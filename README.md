**Soluci√≥n:**

First,I logged to the azure CLI using my student account

After that, I initialized terraform using the command

````
terraform init
````
Once that was done, the next thing I did was check the indentation using the command

````
terraform fmt
````
Then, I checked the HCL in order to discover missing features required to build the function.
